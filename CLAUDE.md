# TutorDeck — project context

## What this is
TutorDeck is a tutor admin web app (students, weekly planner, calendar, ledger/payments,
PayNow invoices, WhatsApp reminders, exams, student profiles). It started as
"T-Leng Tuition Dashboard" and is being rebranded to TutorDeck.
Company: TutorDeck Pte. Ltd. (Singapore), founded by Raphael and T-Leng. We are both
developers AND we both use the app live for our own tuition businesses.

## Stack
- Plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, no framework (vanilla JS, Chart.js, html2canvas).
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth) for data and accounts. Row-level security on every table
  (tutor_id = auth.uid()). The publishable/anon key in assets/js/config.js is safe to commit.
  NEVER commit service-role keys or SMTP passwords.
- Google Identity Services for Google sign-in (via Supabase) and Google Calendar sync.
- See README.md for the file structure, DB migrations, and the running change log.
- `db/schema.sql` is stale — the live Supabase DB is the source of truth for columns.

## Hosting & deploys
- GitHub repo: TutorDecks/TutorDeck (org "TutorDecks"; moved from tlengengtuition-oss/tuitiondashboard).
- Hosted on Vercel (project "tutordeck"). Live: https://tutordeck.vercel.app
  Custom domain https://www.tutordeck.com.sg is being activated (DNS pending).
- GitHub Pages is no longer used. Old github.io URLs are dead — flag any hard-coded
  references to tlengengtuition-oss.github.io in the code and replace them.

## Branch workflow (important)
- `main` = PRODUCTION. Every merge to main auto-deploys to the live site within ~1 min.
  `main` is protected: no direct pushes, changes only via pull request.
- `dev` = staging (Vercel preview URL).
- Work on short-lived `feature/<short-name>` branches off `dev` → PR into `dev` → test
  on the preview link → PR `dev` → `main`.
- Never suggest pushing straight to main or force-pushing.

## Data warning
There is only ONE Supabase database, and it holds REAL student/payment data.
Preview and dev deployments also hit this live DB. So:
- Don't write code or run scripts that bulk-delete/modify data without asking me first.
- Test with dummy students.
- Any new `db/migration_*.sql` must be run in the Supabase SQL editor BEFORE the code that
  needs it is merged to main, or pages will error with "column does not exist". Because
  previews hit the same DB, run it before the code lands on `dev` too.
- A separate dev Supabase project is planned but not set up yet.

## Conventions
- Bump the cache-buster (`?v=N`) in every page when CSS/JS changes: `bash bump-version.sh <N>`.
  Check `main` first so we don't both ship the same number.
- Add an entry to the "Raphael's updates" log in README.md for each change (newest first).
- Keep mobile layouts working (app is heavily used on phones; breakpoint 820px).
- Shared helpers live on `window.TL` in assets/js/app.js; pages call `TL.requireAuth("navId", init)`.
- No Node here. Syntax-check JS with JavaScriptCore by wrapping the file in `new Function`:
  `/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Versions/A/Helpers/jsc -e "new Function(readFile('assets/js/ledger.js')); print('ok')"`

## Current to-dos
1. Rebrand "T-Leng Tuition" → "TutorDeck" across the UI (titles, login card, invoices, emails).
2. Find/replace any hard-coded old github.io URLs (Supabase redirectTo, emails, etc.).
   As of 2026-10-17 none remain in the code; check Supabase Auth → URL Configuration
   and email templates, which live outside the repo.
3. Sync `dev` with `main` (done on 2026-10-17 in feature/sync-main-claude-md, v144).
4. Later: separate dev Supabase project; custom SMTP for auth emails; Vercel Pro before
   charging customers (Hobby plan is non-commercial).
